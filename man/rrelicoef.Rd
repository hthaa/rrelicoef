\title{Raykov's factor reliability coefficient}
\usage{
rrelicoef(mod)
}
\description{
This function computes Raykov's reliability coefficient (RRC) for factors from
confirmatory factor analyses, a measure which is commonly seen as a more
accurate one than that of Cronbach's alpha which is computed based on the
assumption of tau-equivalent measures. It computes reliability coefficients
for factors with and without correlated errors.
